# /visual-audit [staging-url]

Dispatch the Product Designer for a full visual fidelity audit on the staging deployment.
Runs after all feature waves pass QA, before `/pre-handoff`.

Usage: `/visual-audit https://[app]-staging.vercel.app`

## Pre-flight checks

Before dispatching, confirm:
- [ ] All features in `artifacts/plans/project-plan.md` are marked complete (all QA PASS)
- [ ] Staging URL is live and accessible
- [ ] A staging URL argument was provided

If any check fails: report to human, do not dispatch.

## Dispatch

Launch Product Designer subagent (foreground):

```
Task: Post-Build Visual Fidelity Audit

Read:
- .cursor/agents/product-designer.md (your full instructions — see Post-build section)
- .cursor/rules/design-system.mdc (AI Slop Guard rules)
- .cursor/rules/copy-rules.mdc (copy quality test)
- agent-workspace/ACTIVE_CONTEXT.md
- artifacts/docs/design-system-spec.md
- artifacts/docs/screen-specs-[app]-v1.md (all screen metadata)
- artifacts/docs/northstar-[app].html (§7b landing page content)

Staging URL: [staging-url]

Compare staging screens against the original Make component code in src/make-import/ (or git history if already deleted).
Do NOT use Figma MCP tools — they do not work with Make.

Run the full visual fidelity audit:
- **Make fidelity (CRITICAL)** — since screens are copied directly from Make, every Tailwind class, spacing value, color, font-weight, border-radius, and animation timing must be IDENTICAL to Make's original code. Any visual difference means the agent modified code it shouldn't have. Compare staging against Make's original files in src/make-import/ (or git history). Flag every deviation as BLOCKING.
- AI Slop Guard rules (design-system.mdc)
- Token compliance — no raw colors, no arbitrary spacing
- Mobile viewport at 375px — every screen
- All four interaction states visible — default / loading / error / empty
- No placeholder text or lorem ipsum
- Copy quality — run 5-question Copy Quality Test on all visible copy
- Dopamine moment fidelity — for D1–D4 flagged screens: verify animation timing matches EDS §6. Since Make implemented these, they should be untouched — if timing differs, the agent modified animation code it shouldn't have.
- Share card rendering — if applicable

Landing page specific checks (at `/`):
- All 8 sections present and visible
- View page source — full HTML present (pre-rendered, not empty SPA shell)
- CTA fires install prompt (Android) or shows iOS instructions
- FAQ accordion functional, all items from §7b present
- Already-installed state handled

Signal completion with a findings report.
```

## After completion

**If no BLOCKING findings:**
1. Update project-plan.md — mark visual audit complete
2. Report to human: "Visual audit complete. No blocking findings. Ready for `/pre-handoff`."

**If BLOCKING findings:**
1. Present findings to human
2. Dispatch Frontend Developer to fix each BLOCKING item
3. After fixes: re-run `/visual-audit [staging-url]`
