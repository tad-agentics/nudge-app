# RAD — Rapid App Development

RAD is a multi-agent development template for Cursor that ships complete, production-ready web applications in 2–3 days. You define the product. Figma Make designs it. A coordinated team of AI agents builds it — backend, frontend, QA, design, devops, and research — each with strict boundaries, structured handoffs, and human approval gates.

RAD is not a framework or a library. It is a set of agent instructions, slash commands, skills, and quality checks that turn Cursor into a managed development team. The human acts as Tech Lead — making architectural decisions, approving gates, and steering the product. The agents do the construction.

## What RAD Solves

Building an app with AI agents without structure produces inconsistent, fragile output. Agents guess at architecture, skip edge cases, hallucinate integrations, and build features that contradict each other. RAD solves this by:

- **Constraining each agent to a narrow domain** — the backend agent never touches frontend code, the frontend agent never writes migrations, the QA agent never self-resolves security decisions. Each agent reads only the files it needs and produces only the artifacts it owns.
- **Enforcing a linear pipeline with gates** — no phase starts until the previous phase is approved. The northstar is validated before scaffolding. The tech spec is approved before building. Each feature passes QA before the next wave starts. No agent self-proceeds.
- **Making the design the source of truth** — Figma Make generates a complete working React app with mock data. The frontend agent's job is integration (swap mocks for real Supabase queries), not construction. This eliminates the "AI rewrote my UI" problem — 90% of Make's code stays untouched.
- **Validating technical decisions before code** — a complexity scan identifies features that need research (billing, real-time, complex auth). The Research Agent investigates implementation patterns on the specific stack. The tech spec documents every non-trivial decision with options considered, research basis, and revisit triggers.
- **Catching problems at every layer** — 66 automated rule checks, per-feature health scores, schema anti-pattern checklists, structured dogfooding, and a security audit before every deploy.

## Stack

React Router v7 (Vite) · Supabase · TanStack React Query · Vercel · Tailwind CSS · Figma Make

## How It Works

You talk to a **Tech Lead** agent in Cursor. It orchestrates 6 specialist subagents — backend, frontend, QA, product design, devops, and research — each with a narrow domain, defined inputs, and structured outputs. Slash commands dispatch the right agent with the right context. You approve gates. Agents build.

The key insight: **Figma Make produces a complete working React app with mock data.** The frontend agent copies Make's files directly into route files, then applies targeted edits — swap mock data for Supabase queries, fix import paths, add loading/error/empty states. Layout, styling, and animations stay untouched. This cuts screen build time from hours to minutes.

## Principles

Three principles shape every agent's behavior:

1. **Completeness is cheap.** AI makes the marginal cost of the full implementation near-zero. Always do the complete thing — all edge cases, all states, all tests. The delta is minutes.
2. **Search before building.** Check if Supabase, React Router, TanStack, or Tailwind has a built-in before rolling custom. Three knowledge layers: tried-and-true, new-and-popular, first-principles.
3. **User sovereignty.** Agents recommend, the human decides. No agent self-proceeds past a blocking gate.

## Safety

- **Destructive command guardrails** — shell hooks intercept `rm -rf`, `DROP TABLE`, `git push --force`, and other destructive patterns before execution.
- **Security audit** — OWASP Top 10, RLS verification, secrets scanning, and dependency supply chain checks run before every production deploy.
- **Self-regulation** — QA fix loops track a WTF-likelihood score. If fixes start causing more problems than they solve, the agent stops and escalates.
- **Escalation protocol** — any agent can stop and say "this is too hard." Three failed attempts on the same task triggers automatic escalation.

```

### Create Your Repo

```bash
gh repo create [app-name] --template your-org/rad-starter --private --clone
cd [app-name]
```

### Build Sequence

| Step | Command | What happens | Gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | _(external)_ | Write northstar + EDS in Claude.ai / Gemini / any collaborative tool | Place in `artifacts/docs/` |
| 2 | `/office-hours` | Validate northstar structure + stress-test the idea | All 12 sections pass |
| 3 | `/init` | Scaffold project, install deps, link Vercel | Fill `.env.local` + MCP tokens |
| 4 | `/phase2` | Screen specs + Figma Make brief | Approve, then design in Make |
| 5 | _(manual)_ | Copy Make code to `src/make-import/` | — |
| 6 | `/phase4` | Tech spec (complexity scan → targeted research → invariants → schema → contracts) | Approve |
| 7 | `/setup` | Build plan with feature dependency graph | Approve |
| 8 | `/foundation` | Backend infra → Frontend foundation (unattended) | Auto |
| 9 | `/feature [name]` | Backend → Frontend → QA per feature, in waves | Approve each QA PASS |
| 10 | `/visual-audit [url]` | Visual fidelity check on staging | Fix BLOCKING items |
| 11 | `/dogfood` | Human uses staging app, records findings | Fix BLOCKING items |
| 12 | `/pre-handoff` | Security audit + quality review | Approve |
| 13 | `/deploy [ref]` | Push to production | Smoke check |

See `RAD-GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions at each step.

## Architecture

```
Frontend (React SPA on Vercel)          Supabase (sole backend)
├── React Router v7 + Vite + Tailwind   ├── Postgres + RLS
├── TanStack React Query (cache)        ├── Auth (email, OTP, OAuth)
├── Pre-rendered landing at /           ├── Edge Functions (LLM, webhooks, cron)
├── SPA for /app/* (auth-guarded)       ├── Storage
├── Make TSX → route files              └── Realtime (if needed)
└── @supabase/supabase-js
```

No server runtime in the frontend. No middleware. No API routes. RLS is the single authorization boundary. Edge Functions handle anything needing server-only keys.

---

## Agent Team

| Agent | Domain | Invoked via |
|---|---|---|
| **Tech Lead** | Orchestration, architecture, gates | Main Cursor session |
| **Product Designer** | Screen specs, Make briefs, visual QA | `/phase2`, `/visual-audit` |
| **Backend Developer** | Schema, migrations, RLS, Edge Functions | `/foundation`, `/feature` |
| **Frontend Developer** | Screen integration, components, mobile | `/foundation`, `/feature` |
| **QA Agent** | Feature validation, health scoring, security audit | `/feature`, `/pre-handoff` |
| **DevOps Agent** | Production deploy | `/deploy` |
| **Research Agent** | Integration docs + technical pattern research | `/research`, auto from `/phase4` |

All agents follow standardized protocols: structured question format, completion status signals (DONE / BLOCKED / NEEDS_CONTEXT), and the escalation rule.

---

## Quality Infrastructure

- **Northstar validation + stack fit** — `/office-hours` validates all 12 required sections plus checks product requirements against known stack constraints (Edge Function timeouts, Realtime connection limits, file processing caps). Mismatches are flagged before any code is written.
- **Technical complexity scan** — Phase 4 scans features against a checklist of complexity signals (money/credits, real-time, file processing, complex auth, search, state machines). Features with signals get targeted research before the spec is written.
- **Selective technical research** — the Research Agent handles both external integrations (Mode 1) and implementation pattern research (Mode 2). Complex features get domain-specific pattern docs that directly inform the schema design.
- **Architecture reference** — the Tech Lead has a knowledge base (`.cursor/skills/architecture/SKILL.md`) with stack constraints, domain patterns (credit billing, subscriptions, multi-tenant, social feeds), and a technical decision template.
- **Data invariants** — Phase 4 enumerates business rules (what must always be true) before designing the schema. Invariants drive CHECK constraints, indexes, and RLS policies.
- **Schema anti-pattern checklist** — 15 checks against known failure modes: missing transaction logs, incorrect cascades, race conditions, RLS gaps, missing indexes.
- **66 automated rule checks** — banned patterns, copy-then-edit enforcement, TanStack usage, CORS, staleness detection. Runs on every agent stop.
- **Per-feature health scores** — weighted across visual fidelity, data/perf, security, interaction flows, build/tests, and copy. Stored as `baseline.json` for regression comparison.
- **Diff-aware QA** — scopes testing to changed files and affected routes.
- **Structured dogfooding** — between visual audit and pre-handoff, the builder uses the staging app for 30–60 minutes with a generated task list, records findings, and validates assumptions from office hours.
- **Root cause investigation** — complex bugs use a 4-phase protocol: investigate → analyze → hypothesize → implement.
- **Atomic commits** — one commit per fix, bisect-friendly history.
